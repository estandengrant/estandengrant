# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

For reasons related to confidentiality and compliance/legal restrictions, I am unable to share copies of my professional work. Therefore, I have complied this small Github page to provide some sample work relating to Machine Learning, Deep Learning & general computing projects / workflows.

### Repositories: ðŸ“‚
- CovNet _Classifier: Construction of Neural Network designed to process and classify image data. Data from Microsoft.
- KNN_Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm construction in Numpy and testing against Iris dataset.
- Neural_Network_Utilities: Python module containing functions and utilities to construct a Neural Network from scratch and perfom forward propagation.
- Support_Vector_Machine_From_Scratch: Creation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. Tested against SKLearns SVM model
- Natural_Language_Neural_Network_Model: Natural language processing and use of Deep Learning model to detect potentially alarming text messages relating to mental health problems.
- LSTM_Time_Series_Prediction: Use of LSTM model to predict price movement of cryptocurrency.
  
For any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
