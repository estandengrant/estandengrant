# Welcome!

For reasons related to confidentiality and compliance/legal restrictions, I am unable to share copies of my professional work. Therefore, I have complied this small Github page to provide some sample work relating to Machine Learning, Deep Learning & general computing projects / workflows.

Each repository contains a README file detailing the work conducted and the various tools used as well as any specific requirements and versions needed.

For any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
