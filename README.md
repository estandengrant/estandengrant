# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

For reasons related to confidentiality and compliance/ legal restrictions, I am unable to share copies of my professional work. Therefore, I have complied this Github page containing several small work samples relating to Machine Learning, Deep Learning & general computing projects / pipelines.

### Repositories: ðŸ“‚
- #CovNet _Classifier#: Construction of Convelutional Neural Network designed to process and classify image data. Data provided by Microsoft in connection to their CAPTCHA authentication process.
- KNN_Algorithm: Development of K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm from first principles to solve multiclass classification problems - Model tested against well-known Iris dataset.
- Neural_Network_Utilities: Python module containing classes and utilities needed to construct a Neural Network from first principles - Includes Node and layer construction as well as utilities for forward propagation and cost calculation.
- Support_Vector_Machine_From_Scratch: Development of Support Vector Machine (SVM) from first principles - Tested against SKLearns SVM model.
- Natural_Language_Neural_Network_Model: Jupyter Notebook project exploring the benefits of using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to classify text-message sentiment in relation to mental health awareness.
- LSTM_Time_Series_Prediction: Deep Learning project to forecast cryptocurrency prices - workflow and processing pipeline, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model implimentation.
