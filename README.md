# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

In adherence to stringent confidentiality and regulatory compliance requirements, I am precluded from disseminating copies of my professional work. To circumvent this limitation, I have curated a compilation of concise demonstrations on this GitHub page, showcasing my proficiency in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and general computational methodologies.


### Repositories Overview: ðŸ“‚
- **CovNet _Classifier**: This repository details the assembly of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) engineered for the interpretation and classification of image data. The dataset is provided by Microsoft, specifically pertaining to their CAPTCHA authentication mechanism.
- **KNN_Algorithm**: Development of K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm from first principles to solve multiclass classification problems - efficacy of this model has been evaluated using the renowned Iris dataset.
- **Neural_Network_Utilities**: A comprehensive Python module offering an assortment of classes and tools essential for the foundational development of Neural Networks. It encompasses the creation of nodes and layers, alongside functionalities for executing forward propagation and computing costs.
- **Support_Vector_Machine_From_Scratch**: An explorative development of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) from first principles. This project includes a comparative analysis against the SVM model provided by SKLearn.
- **Natural_Language_Neural_Network_Model**: An investigative Jupyter Notebook project that delves into the integration of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques for the sentiment classification of text messages, with a particular focus on mental health awareness.
- **LSTM_Time_Series_Prediction**: A Deep Learning initiative aimed at predicting cryptocurrency valuations through a meticulously structured workflow and processing pipeline, employing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.
